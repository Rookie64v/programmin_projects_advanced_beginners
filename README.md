# What
This repository contains the implementations of **Programming Projects for Advanced Beginners**, simple-ish programming tasks devised by Robert Heaton. If you are interested, you can find them [here](https://robertheaton.com/2018/12/08/programming-projects-for-advanced-beginners/).

# Why
I need practice. Everyone needs practice! Also I tend to aim for frankly unrealistic projects which need some library which I need to write, and that library could use a compiler that I also need to write, and so I end up doing nothing. So, here we are.

# How
Python. Hopefully standard library, might need additional stuff however.
